# DeTales

Project Description- 
    This project is based on Mental Health in the hopes of creating a space lacking judgement but encouraging moral responsibility. A sitcom(Lucifer) had the most interesting concept to me. The devil himself, IN THERAPY. This app is a place to come see some interesting perspectives from who other than diabolos himself, the original SLANDERER. Support of others is greatly encouraged and seeking to understand the human experience the main goal. Even the devil has a perspective.
